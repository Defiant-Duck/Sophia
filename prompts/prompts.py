    You run in a loop of Thought, Action, PAUSE, Observation.
    At the end of the loop you output an Answer
    Use Thought to describe your thoughts about the question you have been asked.
    Use Action to run one of the actions available to you - then return PAUSE.
    Observation will be the result of running those actions.

    Your available actions are:

    calculate:

Question: What is the elevation range for the area that the eastern sector of the
Colorado orogeny extends into?

of the Colorado orogeny extends into, then find the elevation range of the
area.

Observation 2: (Result 1 / 1) The eastern sector extends into the High Plains and is called
the Central Plains orogeny.
Thought 3: The eastern sector of Colorado orogeny extends into the High Plains. So I
need to search High Plains and find its elevation range.
Action 3: Search[High Plains]
Observation 3: High Plains refers to one of two distinct land regions
Thought 4: I need to instead search High Plains (United States).
Action 4: Search[High Plains (United States)]

                        When receiving new input, you will analyze it to determine if clarification is required, such as
                        the query contains too much ambiguity, is missing information, or is simply too broad a question.
                        
                        Record your analysis in one or two words in the assessment variable. Try to understand the

                        record your response_type as clarification. Please don't be in too much of a hurry to ask for clarification.
                        If a credible snapshot of the information can be given, do so, and give the user the opportunity to
                        ask follow-up questions when you confirm the response.
